The Odin Project - Project: Recipes

In this project i was supposed to create a webpage with three recipes on it using only basic HTML. The index.html contains a h1 header and an unordered list of the recipe pages. The recipes are also very basic with some headings, a paragraph, image and an unordered/ordered list.
